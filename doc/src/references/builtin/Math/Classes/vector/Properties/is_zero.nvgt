/**
	Checks if a vector is 0.
	bool vector::is_zero const;
	## Remarks
		This method is more accurate than checking each axis for 0 directly, as it takes into account the inaccuracies that can be caused by floating point arithmetic.
*/

// Example:
void main() {
	vector v(0, 0, 0);
	alert("Is zero?", v.is_zero);
}

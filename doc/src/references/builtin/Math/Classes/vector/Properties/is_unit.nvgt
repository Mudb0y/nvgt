/**
	Checks if a vector has a length of 1 (I.E. the vector is normalised).
	bool vector::is_unit const;
	## Remarks
		This method is more accurate than checking each axis for 0 directly, as it takes into account the inaccuracies that can be caused by floating point arithmetic.
*/

// Example:
void main() {
	vector v(5, 4, 8);
	v.normalize();
	alert("Is unit?", v.is_unit);
}

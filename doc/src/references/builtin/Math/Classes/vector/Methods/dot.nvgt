/**
	Returns the dot product of two vectors.
	float vector::dot(const vector&in other);
	## Arguments:
		* other: The vector to sum.

	## Remarks
		The dot product is a measure of how much two vectors point in the same direction. This is often used in physics for checking if an object is moving into or away from a surface, measuring forces, or calculating angles.
		* Returns a positive value if both vectors point roughly in the same direction.
		* Returns zero if the vectors are perpendicular (at right angles, not pointing the same way at all).
		* Returns a negative value if the vectors point in opposite directions.
		The dot product is calculated as (ax * bx) + (ay * by) + (az * bz).

// Example:
void main() {
	vector v1(1, 2, 3);
	vector v2(4, 5, 6);
	alert("Dot", v2.dot(v1)); // (1 * 4) + (2 * 5) + (3 * 6) = 32.
}

# deserialize
Deserializes the contents of a string into a dictionary.

`dictionary@ deserialize(const string&in);`

## Arguments:

## Remarks:
The format used for serializing/deserializing is different to that used by BGT.

The corresponding `serialize` function can be found as a method in the dictionary class.
